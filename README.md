# QuackBook

QuackBook is an interactive SQL notebook powered by DuckDB WASM, enabling users to run SQL queries, analyze data, and
explore insights directly in the browser without the need for a backend.

### Motivation

Nothing other than a challenge. I enjoyed DuckDB a lot and while seeing other existing _duck db in the browser_ apps 
I wanted to build my own. I also love Vue. So the combo looked cool in my mind 

So here we are.

Bear in mind that this is under active development at the moment. Some things may break... some may may be fixed 🙂‍↕️.

### What can QuackBook do?

- In-Browser SQL Execution: Run SQL queries seamlessly within your browser.
- DuckDB Integration: Leverage DuckDB's capabilities for efficient data processing.
- Interactive Data Analysis: Analyze datasets and visualize results interactively.
- No Backend Required: Entirely client-side operation ensures privacy and simplicity.
