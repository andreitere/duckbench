Hi there.

The internet probably didn’t need another DuckDB-in-the-browser... There are already some great examples out there. I’ve checked them, and they inspired me. I wanted to build one myself. At first, it seemed challenging, but I managed to get through the hurdles quickly and now have a working... something.

Again. Here I am. 

### What's QuackBook?
It’s whatever DuckDB can do, plus some additional graphing and markdown. In the end, it can be whatever you want:

- Data analysis
- Teaching, by combining it with markdown
- Learning from others’ work
- Building charts for your data

### Storing projects

You may have already figured out that this page is editable. All the data came from the link, but now you have a personal copy. Whatever you do to this copy will be saved up to a point.

This represents your activeProject. You can delete, add, edit, reorder, or even refresh—no problem. But if you open another project, you will lose this data. If that’s okay with you, great. But if you want to keep this project for later, you’ll need to save it.

Use "the prompt" and then hit save project. Now you can safely open another project, knowing that this one is stored.



### Sharing projects

Use **"the prompt"** and hit _share project_. You'll get a huge url which contains almost all the details of the project. All the cells will be there.

## NO. There is no server storage.  YOU ACTUALLY OWN YOUR DATA.

Everything is kept in your browser storage. If you switch browsers or clear your local storage... you will lose everything.

Would you find it useful to have proper storage for your projects? like with an account and all the bells and whistles? let me know

### Shortcuts

Meta is either CTRL (windows/linux) or CMD (macos)

- META + Shift + E: show database schema (tables and structure of your tableS)
- META + K: opens **"the prompt"**
